**5. Multisite**

If you use several websites with different janolaw shop/user ID under one TYPO3 extension, you can configure the respective website via the content elements or via the TypoScript configuration.

**IMPORTANT**

Please note that any change to the janolaw documents must be done at www.janolaw.de.
To do so you have to sign in to `My janolaw <https://www.janolaw.de/login.html>`__  and generate a new set of documents, if required.

**NOTE**

Please check the integration of the legal texts on the website. If the integration is correct, the documents you have created will be synchronized, saved and automatically updated via the interface, when changes are made on the respective website.

**Are you operating an online shop, then please consider the followings!**

**Making the order confirmation e-mail legally compliant**
The following documents should be sent to the customer by order confirmation e-mail at the latest with the delivery of the goods.
-  General Terms and Conditions
-  Revocation (Return) Policy
-  Model withdrawal form
-  Data Protection Policy (Privacy Policy)

It is strongly recommended to send the data protection policy in the order confirmation e-mail, in order to avoid a written warning notice based on Art. 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which corresponds to the shop data protection policy. `https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-12-dsgvo/ <https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-12-dsgvo/>`__

The regulation explicitly refers to the transfer to the data subject and not to the general public.

**IMPORTANT**

Please make sure by making a test purchase that you have correctly integrated the documents in the order confirmation e-mail, and that the documents listed above have been automatically integrated via interface.
- If this does not work, then you have to manually add the missing documents to the order confirmation e-mail and the update of the documents must also be done manually, if any change occurs.
- You can send the documents as e-mail attachments by converting each legal text into a PDF file.
- **Alternatively**, you may also copy the legal text into the order confirmation
e-mail below the purchase confirmation or signature. **When using this method, please note** that any modification you have made to the legal texts after being integrated via the interface will be overwritten during the next synchronization.

After log-in you will find your legal texts in word format in your personal account `My janolaw <https://www.janolaw.de/login.html>`__ under

**NOTE**
Simply referring to the legal documents given as a link in the order confirmation e-mail is not complying with the law!


**Textual Changes**

Please note that any change to the janolaw documents must be done at www.janolaw.de. To do so you have to sign in to `My janolaw <https://www.janolaw.de/login.html>`__ and generate a new set of documents, if required.

**Model withdrawal form**

Model withdrawal form should be sent by e-mail at the latest when the goods are delivered. The menu point “model withdrawal form” should be placed as a further menu item or as a link in your internet shop in addition to the links for terms and conditions, imprint, data privacy policy, cancellation instructions, and the active link to the online dispute resolution platform (ODR platform).


**Templet for Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform**

According to the European ODR Regulation (Regulation on the extrajudicial online
settlement of consumer disputes), since 9 January 2016, entrepreneurs who sell
to consumers have to place an **active link to the ODR** platform
(`https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/ <https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/>`__  )
on their web shops and provide the **e-mail address**.

**IMPORTANT::**

The link to the platform must be placed visible and easily accessible on the website. It should not be placed neither in the imprint nor in the GTC because it can be deemed as being hidden.
To be compliant with the regulation the link should have its own menu point in the footer such as GTC or other customer information (e.g. shipping costs, delivery times etc.).

Our text proposal:

The EU Commission provides a platform for out-of-court dispute resolution. This gives consumers the opportunity to initially settle disputes in connection with their online order out of court. The dispute resolution platform can be found here: `https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/ <https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/>`__
Our e-mail address for customer service is: ......@......

**Verifying Integration Error**

Please consider the following possible sources of error:

-  The type of the service purchased:
Please check whether the purchased service contains only the imprint and the data protection policy (suitable for website), or all documents i.e. also GTCs, cancellation policy and model withdrawal form (suitable for online shop).
-  Specification of ID numbers:
Are user-ID (customer number) or shop ID as well as Rechtstexte-ID entered correctly (without spaces) or not mixed up?
-  PHP must be able to have access to other URLs in order to download files there.
-  In the php.ini of the server allow_url_fopen must be activated.
